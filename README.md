# CS230-Operating-Platforms

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
The client was The Gaming Room. They currently had a game called Draw It or Lost It for Android. The Gaming Room wanted to improve the software functionality and to expand to other platforms. I kept this document clear, concise, and to the point.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I wrote a comprehensive recommendation section outlining key areas for the client’s consideration including the host operating system (OS), memory and storage management solutions on host servers, the API framework, security, and the benefits of leveraging serverless architecture to launch the product. I made a strong case as to why a cloud platform was the best choice for the client and their goal.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The evaluation section comparing and contrasting popular OSs (i.e. Mac, Windows, Linux) and mobile platforms could be improved with a deeper dive into the nuances between the platforms on the client side. The web browser is the main client-side concern, as it's the main engine running the app for the client. Research into the nuances between OSs for web-based solutions returned limited insight. OS favor toward particular browsers (i.e. Windows to Edge, Mac to Safari, etc.) could be analyzed in more depth to see if non-favored browsers introduce technical or performance constraints.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I took what the functionality of the game and helped split it up so that there would be less work and time spend expanding to other operating platforms. All while still keeping the game the same. Your client may be the one to ask you to do the work but it is the user's who truely control the product. If they don't trust the software or have problems with it then they won't use it and no more product.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I put my focus on clear documentation and seperating game and game needs functionality to allow easier updates and maintenence.
